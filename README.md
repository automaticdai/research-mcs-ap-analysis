# Analysis of Mixed-Criticality System Approximated Computing (MCS-AP)
## Introduction
This is the code of the schedulability analysis part of our RTSS 2021 paper, "HIART-MCS: High Resilience and Approximated Computing Architecture for Imprecise Mixed-Criticality Systems", by Zhe Jiang, Xiaotian Dai, and Neil Audsley. 

## Usage

1. Run the examples and save outputs with `python3 main.py >> data.txt`

2. Plot the results with MATLAB scripts `plot1.m` and `plot2.m` , do point the directory folder to the right `data.txt`
